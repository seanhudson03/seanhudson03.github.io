        <p class = "center">
            Sean Hudson is a second year computer science student studying at <br>
            the University of Rhode Island. Sean started as a business major, <br>
            but soon realized he would much rather switch into a STEM field,<br>
            because that's what he was used to. Programming aside, Sean enjoys<br>
            spending time with his friends and girlfriend. In between semesters<br>
            Sean works as a part-time bartender, and as the Head Sailing <br>
            Instructor at the Keyport Yacht Club Junior Sailing Program,<br>
            which he has been involved with since he was 7.
