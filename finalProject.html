            Below is Sean Hudson’s final project for CSC 106. This project should look familiar, as it is a handmade version of chess playable in Khan Academy’s Javascript Environment. The rules are simple, following real-life chess rules, with a few exceptions. Just like the real game, this version of chess is turn based, starting with the white team. Each piece is only allowed to move if the move abides by real-life chess laws, with the exception of castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. Each piece must follow its own ruleset, or else the game will not allow the move. In addition, moves that place the current player’s king in check will not be allowed. This includes a move in which the player’s king is already in check, meaning the move must result in the king no longer being in check in order to be legal. All of this is handled by the program itself, so player error is not an issue. If a player’s king is in check and cannot make a legal move to get out of it, that player has been checkmated, and the program will end. This program does not account for any form of draw. Enjoy!
